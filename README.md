# to-do kappa v2

to-do kappa v2 is a rebuilt [to-do_kappa_v1 project](https://github.com/ricc3/to-do_kappa_v1). Still the main idea of the project is to create a simple website based on the principle of a list to do with all the information we need to complete the _Collector_ task in the **[Escape from Tarkov](https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/)** game.

## main assumptions

- ~~Showing the necessary information about the task as well as the reward~~
- ~~Showing the conditions we must meet to unlock the task~~
- ~~Bar with information on:~~
  - ~~Number of missing items~~
  - ~~Search / filter an item by name in the list~~
  - ~~A field with the name of our container in which we keep items~~
  - ~~Button to restart the progression~~
- ~~Shows a list of items needed to collect to complete the task:~~
  - ~~Picture of the object~~
  - ~~The abbreviated name of the subject and the full~~
  - ~~Link to a wiki with information about a specific item~~
- ~~Using local memory to store information~~
